Welcome to the Master Python Dictionary Methods Guide! In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore various built-in methods and operations for working with Python dictionaries. Each method will be explained with examples, providing you with a solid understanding of how to effectively use dictionaries in Python.

## 🤔 Why This Guide? 

Dictionaries in Python are powerful data structures for key-value pair storage. This guide aims to equip you with knowledge about dictionary methods, empowering you to make the most out of dictionaries in your Python projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Python developer, this guide is designed to enhance your skills.

## 🏛️ What's Inside

This guide is organized into sections, each focusing on a specific dictionary method or operation. Let's take a quick look at what's covered:

1. **clear() 🗑️**: Remove all items from the dictionary.

2. **copy() 📋**: Return a shallow copy of the dictionary.

3. **get() 🎯**: Return the value for the specified key, with an option for a default value.

4. **items() 📚**: Return a view of the dictionary's key-value pairs.

5. **keys() 🔑**: Return a view of the dictionary's keys.

6. **values() 📊**: Return a view of the dictionary's values.

7. **pop() 🍇**: Remove and return the item with the specified key.

8. **popitem() 🎁**: Remove and return the last inserted key-value pair.

9. **setdefault() ⚙️**: Return the value for the specified key. If the key does not exist, insert it with a specified value.

10. **update() 🔄**: Update the dictionary with elements from another dictionary or iterable.

11. **in and not in ✅❌**: Check if a key is present in a dictionary.

12. **fromkeys() 🌐**: Return a new dictionary with specified keys and values.

13. **len() 🔢**: Return the number of items in a dictionary.

14. **clear() to empty a dictionary 🗑️**: Use `clear()` to empty a dictionary.

15. **dict() constructor to create a dictionary 📝**: Use the `dict()` constructor to create a dictionary.

16. **Using dict() constructor with keyword arguments 🌐**: Create a dictionary using the `dict()` constructor with keyword arguments.

17. **Deleting an item using del keyword 🗑️**: Delete an item from a dictionary using the `del` keyword.

18. **Using dict() constructor with comprehension 🌐**: Create a dictionary using the `dict()` constructor with a comprehension.

19. **Sorting a dictionary by keys 📊**: Sort a dictionary by keys.

20. **Sorting a dictionary by values 📊**: Sort a dictionary by values.
